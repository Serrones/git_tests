`Now let's use Rebase`

> We are crossing commits from branches master and German_Text.
Either branch is commited one by one

> When we apply rebase command, all German_Text branch will be placed at the
top of master branch

`It's Squash time`

> Squashing commits can make the log more readable and understandable
