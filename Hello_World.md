`Hello World`

> Hy little boy. Welcome to my world, and respect the rules, or you
may lose your files

`Now let's use Rebase`

> We are crossing commits from branches master and German_Text.
Either branch is commited one by one

> When we apply rebase command, all German_Text branch will be placed at the
top of master branch

`It's Squash time`

> Squashing commits can make the log more readable and understandable

> When we apply rebase -i HEAD~<n>, we can choose how many commits we are
going to mix, or something else
